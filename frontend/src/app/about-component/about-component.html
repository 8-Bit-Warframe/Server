	<h2>What are 8-Bit Warframe and Lost Sector?</h2>
	<p>Lost Sector is a retro action/RPG/platformer, set in the Warframe universe. It is the first game being produced as part of the "8-Bit Warframe
		project".</p>
	<h2>Who is making Lost Sector?</h2>
	<p>Lost Sector is being worked on by a multitude of people, all of whom are part of the Warframe community. Nearly 100 people have now contributed
		directly to its development!</p>
	<h2>Where did the idea come from?</h2>
	<p>The GIF below was originally created by a member of the Warframe community called Typhuus, and the idea basically just grew from there! (and
		thanks to feature creep, there's a lot more in the works!)</p>
